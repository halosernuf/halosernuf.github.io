Take 1 hour stay at [Twin Peak, San Francisco](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.7518611,-122.4464941,15z)

## Time-lapse

It was freezing cold at the top of it, especially when the wind is blowing. Strong wind isnâ€™t a friend of night photos. In order to take the time-lapse of the backlights of passing vehicles, I have to use my body as a screen to make the camera stable. Otherwise, the light of the building far away in SF downtown will be blurred out.
